					</div>
					<h4>DeShaun Watson - Houston Texans</h4>
					<p>
					Watson was a rookie this past season and before his injury he was putting up MVP caliber numbers. Don't be surprised if he is the top fantasy player of the 2018-19 season. With arguably the best receiver in the game, DeAndre Hopkins, and a rising superstar receiver in his own right, Will Fuller, expect a monstrous season from Watson.

					<h4>Jimmy Garoppolo - San Francisco 49ers</h4>
					<p>
					Jimmy G was lights out for the 49ers at the end of last year. Before they had Jimmy, the Niners won one game. One. After they acquired Jimmy, they finished the season on a 5 game win streak. They don't call him Jimmy Jesus for nothing. Adding Jerrick McKinnon in the backfield and after a huge year from Marquise Goodwin, the 49ers should stun the NFL with Jimmy G leading the charge.

					</div>
					<h4>Patrick Mahomes - Kansas City Chiefs</h4>
					<p>
					Mahomes has not seen a start in his professional career, but he could be a late round steal this year. The Chiefs are in no shortage of offensive weapons with Kelce, Hill, and Hunt all healthy. Andy Reid had enough faith in Mahomes to trade Alex Smith, a quarterback who had 5 interceptions on the whole year, and give Mahomes the starting job. Mahomes could be a standout flex quarterback.

					</div>
					<h4>Kenyan Drake - Miami Dolphins</h4>
					<p>
					Drake is a former Alabama running back and if there's something the SEC gets right, it's running backs. The Dolphins had an underwhelming year overall but, after the Ajayi trade, Drake emrged as the clear starter. With Ryan Tannehill returning to the field, this offense should be able to produce a bit more this season (even with the loss of Jarvis Landry). <font color=#ff8000>Hail Mary prediction:</font> Kenyan Drake will be the best fantasy running back in the AFC East.

					</div>
					<h4>Dion Lewis - Tennessee Titans</h4>
					<p>
					Getting out of that crowded backfield in New England is an automatic boost to Lewis. His play style is going to add a two headed dragon to the Titans run game. Derrick Henry is the first-down-hard-nose back but, when it comes to the passing out of the back, Dion should dominate the touches. Maybe this alternating run game could be the bolster Mariota and the Titans need.

					</div>
					<h4>Christian McCaffrey - Carolina Panthers</h4>
					<p>
					McCaffrey was a stud at Stanford and proved himself as a capable pass catcher last season with Carolina. Though barely averaging over 3 yards a carry, he should see increased touches with the loss of Jonathan Stewart. The Panthers offense was a bit all over the place last season but, with any consistency from Cam Newton, McCaffrey could serve as a top 15 RB.

					</div>
					<h4>Josh Gordon - Cleveland Browns</h4>
					<p>
					Some of you may be thinking, "well duh". But I felt Gordon needed to be placed here so we could start putting respect on his name. I guarantee about 80% of leagues will incorrectly draft his teammate Jarvis Landry as their number one option. Gordon is the best receiver on the Brown's lineup and it's not even close. Landry is a fine second option but don't sleep on Flash Gordon.

					</div>
					<h4>Will Fuller - Houston Texans</h4>
					<p>
					DeShaun Watson established an almost immediate chemistry with Fuller this past season. On a team where Fuller is the second option, he could be an amazing WR 2 or flex play while the defense is busy doubling DeAndre Hopkins. This does however come with an asterisk as both Watson and Fuller battled injusries last season but, in my opinion, definitely worth the risk.
					</p>

					</div>
					<h4>Jordy Nelson - Oakland Raiders</h4>
					<p>
					The Oakland Raiders have braced themselves for a light show. Some notable additions include Martavis Bryant, Jon Gruden, and Jordy Nelson. Gruden should have Derek Carr playing at a higher level thus bolstering the floor for all the receivers they now have. Nelson was the best receiver in fantasy just a few short years ago with the Packers. He may be worth the late round gamble.

					</div>
					<h4>Jimmy Graham - Green Bay Packers</h4>
					<p>
					All star caliber tight end + Aaron Rodgers = must draft. Graham had a very up and down experience in Seattle but I believe this move to the Packers will elevate him back to world of fantasy consistency. Try to stay ahead of the curve when drafting a tight end because once the top few are gone there's really not many options left. Graham would be a steal in the fifth or sixth round.

					</div>
					<h4>George Kittle - San Francisco 49ers</h4>
					<p>
						Kittle might as well have been a free agent all last season until Jimmy Jesus showed up. In the last game of the season Kittle had 100 yards and it couldn't be any clearer that chemistry was developing. I mean let's be real, Jimmy G is coming from a team that has the best QB/TE relationship in the history of football. Of course he would have a skill set and playbook mindset that would bode well for his new tight end.
					</p>

					</div>
					<h4>Tyler Eifert - Cincinnati Bengals</h4>
					<p>
					Y'all wanna talk about a gamble? Well here it is. When healthy, Eifert can be a top three tight end with no doubt about it. When he's on the field he gets more red zone looks than A.J. Green and that is saying something. This is a huge risk however. What should be an optimistic time for Eifert has been delayed as he has yet to make an appearance at training camp. Put a pin in this though. He's a big IF but, it could pay off.

					</div>
					<h4>Los Angeles Chargers</h4>
					<p>
					A lot of people may think this is also a late round no brainer, the Chargers ended as a top five defense last season after all. But I feel this defense is not getting the recognition it deserves. After 18 interceptions and a combined 43 sacks, this Chargers defense will still probably be the eigth or ninth defense taken in your draft. That is what we refer to as highway robbery.

					<div class="thumbnail"><img src="https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/PIT.svg">
					</div>
					<h4>Pittsburgh Steelers</h4>
					<p>
					The Steelers lost their star linebacker Ryan Shazier to a scary injury late last season. This defense will not be the same without him but, they will still exceed expectations in my opinion. Pittsburgh is an all around solid team that added a great first round safety in Terrell Edmunds. Not to mention any team that plays the Browns twice a season may be a safe bet either way.

					</div>
					<h4>Tennessee Titans</h4>
					<p>
					The Titans had an under-appreciated defense last year. Kevin Byard led the league in interceptions meanwhile rookie corner Adoree Jackson and veteran blitzer Jurrell Casey put the fear of the Lord in opposing quarterbacks. Tennessee added veteran Malcolm Butler to make the defensive back position even more stacked. On top of all this, they play cig rippin' Blake Bortles twice a year.

					<h4>Jake Elliot - Philadelphia Eagles</h4>
					<p>
					An accurate kicker on a the Super Bowl Championship team should be a no-brainer. This guy is young and still may be a bit unrecognized when you consider the other talent on his squad. Carson Wentz promised this kid his game check if he made a 53 yard field goal. If Wentz is going to continue to give this kid that kind of incentive, he should stay lights out all season.

					</div>
					<h4>Mason Crosby - Green Bay Packers</h4>
					<p>
					Aaron Rodgers is back in town therefore so is the Packers offense as a whole. Crosby was subpar last season due in large part of injuries plaguing the offense. With a few key guys coming back healthy and a few new additions to the team, the Pack should be able to put up some major points this season. I feel like Rodgers could lead a drive into field goal range in his sleep. Therfore, Crosby is about to have a resurgence.

					</div>
					<h4>Will Lutz - New Orleans Saints</h4>
					<p>
					The Saints were 10 seconds and one game away from the Super Bowl last year. This team is exemplary all around. Drew Brees is an all time great, Michael Thomas is a top 10 receiver any given week, and Alvin Kamara is arguably the best thing since sliced sourdough. The key to a good kicker is a good scoring offense and these dudes got that down pat. Lutz will subsequently be a top percentile kicker.

					<h4>Jameis Winston - Tampa Bay Buccaneers</h4>
					<p>
					The Bucs had a rough season last go of it and with Winston being suspended the first four games this season, it's probabbly gonna be hard to find a silver lining. Just a few memories ago Mike Evans was top dog on the fantasy hill but I don't see any way that Evans' heroics could make Winston a viable option.

					<h4>Blake Bortles - Jacksonville Jaguars</h4>
					<p>
					Sacksonville is a great team. Stellar defense. Stellar backfield. Can you imagine how good they would be if they had a competent quarterback? Blake Bortles just is not the guy that can get it done. The Jags have some deep threat potential with Keelan Cole and Marqise Lee but they haven't shown real star potential. The Jaguars lost their best receivers in free agency this offseason in Allen Hurns and Allen Robinson so Bortles has even fewer redeeming qualities.

					<h4>Tyrod Taylor - Cleveland Browns</h4>
					<p>
					I know I just got done telling you how you should respect the Browns receiving corps but stick with me here. I'm not hating on Tyrod. I'm just saying he is under a lot of pressure. The Browns took Baker Mayfield as the first overall pick in the draft. The fans are gonna demand to see that guy in action. If Tyrod has one bad half of football, I wouldn't be surprised to see a new quarterback in the second.

					<h4>Rashaad Penny - Seattle Seahawks</h4>
					<p>
					When the Seahawks drafted Penny in the first round, a lot of people were scratching their heads. This draft had a lot of running talent and Penny certainly was not considered among first round level talent by many. I'm rooting for the guy but let's put all of the personal doubt aside and call it like it is, the Seahawks haven't been able to establish a run game since they lost Beast Mode. Russel Wilson, the quarterback, led the team in rushing last season. It just isn't logical to draft Rashaad with any conviction.

					<h4>Sony Michel - New England Patriots</h4>
					<p>
					Sony is a tremendous talent. Bill Belichick loves him. He could have a great career but, I don't think his potential will be realized this season. Patriots run by committee and they feed the hot hand. Having any Pats running back is a bit of a gamble. You just have no idea who will get consistent touches each week. If injuries or any unforseen benchings end up barring some of the committee from the field then Michel may be a good option but, until then, let him go.

					<h4>LeSean McCoy - Buffalo Bills</h4>
					<p>
					I gotta admit, this one is a stretch. Shady will have an okay year in my opinion but, to his standards, I think he will under-perform. The Bills lost a lot of good guys this offseason. It's hard to imagine they will return to the playoffs. McCoy is going to be 30 years old and the majority of the offense is going to be on his shoulders. Not to mention that nine weeks last season he didn't finish in the top 20 fantasy running backs. I think this will be the first official season of his decline.

					<h4>Larry Fitzgerald - Arizona Cardinals</h4>
					<p>
					Larry is an all time great but the team around him simply isn't in a good place. The current starting quarteback is Sam Bradford. You know, the man made of glass. I honestly don't expect three games out of him this season. Then his backup, Josh Rosen, will enter stage left. Rosen has a huge chip on his shoulder but I haven't seen anything so far that would make me want to bet on him week in and week out. In my opinion, you gotta pass up on Fitz.

					<h4>Michael Crabtree - Baltimore Ravens</h4>
					<p>
					Crabtree was with the Raiders last season but now he's with the Ravens. I still have faith in Derek Carr to be an alright quarterback but, I have lost all faith in Joe Flacco. The last Baltimore receiver that was relevant in the fantasy world was Steve Smith Sr. and that's been a while. Unless they fast track Lamar Jackson under center, I wouldn't expect much from this guy.

					<h4>T.Y. Hilton - Indianapolis Colts</h4>
					<p>
					Flash back to a better time for the Colts and no, I don't mean the Manning era. I mean when Andrew Luck was the best player in all of fantasy and T.Y. was the best receiver in the whole kingdom. Those times are unfortunately far behind us. Hilton managed a few good outings last season with Jacoby Brissett taking the reins but there was no shred of consistency. Luck is hopeful to be able to return this season but, after years of battling injury, he may not be the same as he once was even if he does return.
