	<h2>Freshmen</h2>

	<div class="quote">
	<p>
		There are a whole lot of freshman in the rankings for fantasy this year. We are about to begin the second week of preseason football and already we have had a couple of rookie injuries and training camp scares. Can we trust any of the rookies to impact the fantasy scene? What about some of these new look quarterbacks?
	</p>
	</div>

	<p>
		If we are being completely honest with ourselves, there are very few rookies that could aid your fantasy team and one of them, Derrius Guice, is out for the season. Rashaad Penny broke a finger and will be out about a month but even before the injury he was not the first running back listed on the Seattle depth chart. Guys like Sony Michel or Nick Chubb are in super crowded running back committees and I just do not see them being worth their ADP.
	</p>

	<p>
		As most years though, the running back position is the best bet for rookie upside potential. Some of the realest rookie options are Saquon Barkley, Royce Freeman, and Ronald Jones II. These are the rookies that have either been dubbed the RB1 for week 1 or, they seem to be overtaking their predecessor in swift fashion. After all, rookie running backs have led the league in rushing for what... the past three seasons? There was Kareem Hunt, Ezekiel Elliot, and Todd Gurley in back to back to back seasons. If the trend continues this year, the obvious front runner would be Barkley but, don't sleep on some of the other guys out there.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	    There are a few, and I mean a few, possible breakout rookie receivers. So far, the Carolina Panthers camp won't shut up about DJ Moore. The Carolina offense is in desperate need for a go-to receiver and they may throw him in the first team just to see what he can do. Keeping it in the division, the Atlanta Falcons added Calvin Ridley out of Alabama. If you are in a dynasty league, he's not a bad handcuff to have for now. In terms of this season though, I don't see him taking touches away from Jones or Sanu or even Hooper if we are being real. There is a guy by the name of Courtland Sutton who is out in Denver. I think this year is a resurgence for the Broncos' passing game but, again, I do not think he will be getting into that first team that really loves Thomas and Sanders.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	    Finally, the moment we have all been waiting for. Which rookie quarterback should you draft this season? None of them. Absolutely none of them. At the absolute most, you can add these cats on the waiver wire because no one is gonna draft 'em. There is hope for Sam Darnold starting week 1 and he looks pretty good but, do NOT draft a Jets quarterback. If you are in a pinch and they are playing a weak secondary next week, waiver for him. The quarterback position is too deep to be drafting lesser guys with lesser experience on lesser teams. Aside from Darnold, none of the others are shaping up to be starters, which is expected. Every team that drafted a quarterback in the first round also added veteran quarterbacks to their roster for a reason. Arizona got Rosen, but added Bradford. Buffalo got Allen, but added McCarron. Cleveland got Mayfield, but added Taylor. After all, starting the rookie QB is what got the Browns in this position in the first place.

	<div class="last">
	<p>
		So many of these rookies are going to have phenomenal careers. Unforunately for most of them, the phenom stuff does not begin this year. Barkley is being drafted as a top 10 guy and some of his fellow running backs are going as early as the fifth round but other than that, you don't need to draft rookies. Have faith that the rookie runners will do well either immediately or just a few weeks in but, the quarterbacks and receivers have a few veterans to beat out first. Fear not though, their time is coming, just not this season.

	<h2>Winners and Losers</h2>

	<div class="quote">
	<p>
		Every season of football is just as unpredictable as the last. With that in mind, let's try to accurately predict it. Today we are talking about winners and losers. Who is gonna have better numbers this year and who is gonna have worse numbers this year. I'm going to avoid the guys I mentioned in the Picks/Busts just because I'm so certain you've already read up on that.
	</p>
	</div>

	<p>
		Let's start with the winners because if you ain't first, you're last. The clear biggest winner this season is none other than <span class="orange">Derek Carr</span>. He is a very promising quarterback that had a very rough time last season. But, his team went out and hired a quarterback coaching legend as their head coach. Carr will be put through the Gruden Grinder every week. Not to mention the added strength of the new look Raiders receiving corps.
	</p>

	<p>
		The next set of winners should be familiar names that you have not heard since good ole Peyton Manning was in the league. <span class="orange">Demaryius Thomas</span> and <span class="orange">Emmanuel Sanders</span> should be legit options for receivers on your team. This Broncos team added a stellar defensive player in Bradley Chubb but they also added a veteran quarterback by the name of Case 'of Busch' Keenum. Keenum proved just how good he can be when he took the Vikings to the NFC championship game last year. Look at what he did from a fantasy standpoint for Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs. What he did for them last season is what he will do for Thomas and Sanders this season.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	    Now let's get on to a few losers of this fantasy season. Other than Shady, who will probably still have a subpar year, the rest of this <span class="orange">Bills</span> offense is gonna be way down. The Bills got rid of Tyrod Taylor and picked up A.J. McCarron and Josh Allen. Their training camp reported that Allen is underperforming to their expectations. Also, the new 'stud' receiver in Kelvin Benjamin is causing drama in the locker room by running his mouth to the media about his old team and teammates. Though he is not saying anything bad about his fellow Bills, it still leaves a bad taste in that locker room. I hate to drag the Bills down. They added Corey Coleman just a few days ago which is a smart decision but still this team will not win anywhere close to 9 games.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	    Sometimes having too many offensive weapons is a bad thing. Sometimes it's only a bad thing for a couple of guys. A guy who I would count among the unfortunate in a shuffle of weapons would be <span class="orange">Carlos Hyde</span>. I honestly do expect a fun year from the Browns offense but will Carlos Hyde subsequently see a reduced role than what he had in San Francisco? Without a doubt. Hyde and Nick Chubb have been bouncing back and forth as to who is the number one on the depth chart and occasionally Duke Johnson even works his way in there. Carlos will be a loser this year in terms of how much his team relies on him.
	</p>

	<div class="last">
	<p>
		Of course you can't list every winner and loser but I wanted to give you all something to think about. Think about similar situations around the league and wonder how it will effect the players around the situation. Who got a better quarterback this season? Who crowded their run game? Who is gonna be fighting every week for their touches? Keep an eye on the teams that come to mind. Eventually all winners emerge and eventually all losers become apparent.

	<h2>Don't Let Fantasy Bias Ruin Your Draft </h2>

	<div class="quote">
	<p>
		If you or your loved ones have experienced any of the following symptoms, you may be entitled to absolutely no compensation. Do you happen to have a favorite NFL team? Are you finding yourself drafting an unusual volume of players from said team? Are these players not paying off how you imagined they would? Well you, my friend, have a bad case of Fantasy Bias.
	</p>
	</div>

	<p>
		Fantasy Bias is in most cases untreatable but, I'll read you your last rights either way. If you insist on drafting multiple players from your favorite team, fix your wrong ideology. Not many teams have enough talent to warrant loading your roster with all their weapons. There are a few that show potential. I mean the Saints, Eagles, and Vikings are pretty well rounded no matter how you slice it. Teams of that caliber will be putting up huge numbers in their good weeks but, everyone is doomed to have their bad weeks. Be realistic. It's called fantasy football because you get to put together your ideal team and the odds of your ideal team being your actual favorite team are beyond zero to one.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	    I can understand drafting a promising rookie or a seasoned vet thats getting a renewed roll but, you gotta keep your heart out of this game. Hate the Cowboys? Well Zeke is gonna have a good year regardless of what you think. Love the Jets? Well no one is gonna have a good year regardless of what you think. Never put all your eggs in one basket because one day those eggs are gonna turn into chickens. And chickens suck at football. And so will your team.
	</p>

    <div class="last">
	<p>
		Excellent rule of thumb: never have more than three players from one team. Never. And I would've said no more than two players if it weren't for the inclusion of kickers and defenses. Here's the problem with overloading your roster with one team: not everybody can have a good week every week. Let's look at a case from last year. You've got AB, Big Ben, Le'Veon, and Juju. Sounds good, right? Except this week, they play the Jaguars. And Big Ben throws five big picks. Guarantee you lost that week. Sure you did pretty well most weeks but if they all flop on the week you play your most hated frenemy, you'll be trading half of them away by Tuesday morning.

	<h2>Is It Too Early To Be Thinking About Fantasy?</h2>

	<div class="quote">
	<p>
		hahahahahahahaha no.
	</p>
	</div>

	<p>
		The fantasy football season approaches about as fast as Christmas. It's grueling. It's aganozing. You start to get antsy. You start to think about how much better you're going to be than your friends. It is oh so bittersweet but, take heart. There is no offseason. If you work hard and do your research in the summer, the regular season will be a breeze.
	</p>

	<p>
		As any veteran of the sport knows, your fate is really decided in the draft. So why not start now? Mock draft lobbies have been open since the NFL Draft. (I've already done five... this week.) Mock drafts are obviously your best prepatory tool. Mock drafts are YOUR summer training camps. Use these training camps to see how the average bear is drafting. Put a tag on a guy you know you for sure want on your team and see, on average, when he's getting drafted. See when other teams are taking their tight ends and their defenses. It will give you a better feel for how your actual draft will go and will keep you ahead of the curve.
	</p>

	<div class="last">
	<p>
		Using the summertime to prepare is the best idea you've had since you picked up Jimmy G in week 7 last fall. It's a no brainer. Take note of who you want to build a team around and pray you get the same draft position you practiced for. All I can say with absolute certainty is that you should take a kicker last and the best available talent first. The rest is up to you. Start now. Throw that hail mary. Go all in.
