	<h2>Is It Too Early To Be Thinking About Fantasy?</h2>

		The fantasy football season approaches about as fast as Christmas. It's grueling. It's aganozing. You start to get antsy. You start to think about how much better you're going to be than your friends. It is oh so bittersweet, but take heart. There is no offseason. If you work hard and do your research in the summer, the regular season will be a breeze.
	</p>

	<p>
		As any veteran of the sport knows, your fate is really decided in the draft. So why not start now? Mock draft lobbies have been open since the NFL Draft. (I've already done five... this week.) Mock drafts are obviously your best prepatory tool. Mock drafts are YOUR summer training camps. Use these training camps to see how the average bear is drafting. Put a tag on a guy you know you for sure want on your team and see, on average, when he's getting drafted. See when other teams are taking their tight ends and their defenses. It will give you a better feel for how your actual draft will go and will keep you ahead of the curve.

	<p>
		Using the summertime to prepare is the best idea you've had since you picked up Jimmy G in week 7 last fall. It's a no brainer. Take note of who you want to build a team around and pray you get the same draft position you practiced for. All I can say with absolute certainty is that you should take a kicker last and the best available talent first. The rest is up to you. Start now. Throw that hail mary. Go all in.
